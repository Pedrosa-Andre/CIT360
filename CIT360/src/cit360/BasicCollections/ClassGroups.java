 * Here I am going to use an ArrayList to divide the class into groups. 
 * ArrayLists are useful because they have a specific order (different from 
 * Sets) and you can insert/remove elements in any point of the list (different 
 * from Queues) using indexes. Each element in the ArrayList has a natural 
 * index number (beginning from 0 until n-1 being 'n' the size on the list) that
 * represents its position on the list.
