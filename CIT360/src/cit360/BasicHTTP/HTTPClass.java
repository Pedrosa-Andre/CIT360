     * HTTP stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol. It serves to define a way 
     * messages will be formatted and was created to facilitate the use of 
     * hypertext (text displayed in computer with hyperlinks [references to 
     * other texts the reader can access]) in the World Wide Web. Comparatively, 
     * it's like if you have a lot of texts and media in the web and wants to 
     * create an address to each one of them to find and navigate through them
     * more easily, so the HTTP would the standard to write the addresses.
     * 
     * The HTTP works as a request-response protocol. It involves two elements 
     * (usually a client and a server) where the client asks the server for a 
     * file using an HTTP with the file address and the server reads the HTTP, 
     * verifies where is the file is located, and send it to the client. The
     * HTTP can be also used to request actions, in this case, the server will 
     * return a completion message after reading the HTTP and doing the request.
