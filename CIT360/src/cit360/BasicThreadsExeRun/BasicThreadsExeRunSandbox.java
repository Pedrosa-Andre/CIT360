    // Okay, so let's start with this absolutely interesting subject that is 
    // Threads, Executors, Runnables, and etc. I'm loving to learn about it.

    // Threads are like occupied paths in the CPU memory where tasks can be 
    // performed (I know there are beter definitions on the web, but I tried
    // to use my words here). A process (an instance of a program in execution)
    // can have one or multiple threads.
